## Hello there 👋
Aung is a software engineer focused on frontend development. After finishing up Web Immersive Course from General Assembly, she started at VSA Partners working on simple SPAs and marketing emails, and eventually built a design system for IBM and helped build sunset their old employee profile site, an experience that forever changed how she sees web development.

While at IBM, she worked on large-scale internal tools used by over 300,000 employees globally. She helped design and implement features using Vue (2 and 3), React, TypeScript, and GraphQL, iterating the site through three major versions and collaborating closely with designers, product managers, and backend engineers. Her work included building accessible UI components, extending IBM’s Carbon Design System, and improving IT Support workflows through real-time metrics and integrations with Watsonx AI tools to automate FAQs, appointment scheduling, and ticketing. She also participated in on-call rotations, which deepened her appreciation for performance, reliability, and user feedback. (•̀ᴗ•́)و

She earned her master’s degree in Architecture from the Savannah College of Art and Design and worked in Atlanta, Portland, and New York City. She became a licensed architect with experience at HOK, TVA Architects, and SOM. Her major projects included King Abdullah University of Science and Technology’s auditorium in Saudi Arabia, The New School University Center, Barnard College Library in NYC, and several Nike stores across the U.S.

While she understands that GitHub contributions are a big part of being a software developer, life at IBM was packed with internal work—that’s why her public GitHub looks a little quiet. So here are a few snapshots from her time there.
